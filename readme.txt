Difficulties:

- Uploading the files through GitKraken
- Time management. I greatly underestimated how much time I needed to dedicate towards completing this assignment!
- Allowing the HealthCollectible to increase the player's health (Fixed)
- Getting the Bouncer to work (Fixed, at the cost of locking all enemies in place)
- Getting the Invincibility PowerUp to work as intended (Fixed, but only got it to work in Player.cs)
